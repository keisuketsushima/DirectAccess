Direct Access
======================
This is a simple benchmark test for direct access in Fortran.


How to use
------
+ The most simple style is below
  ./do.sh
+ To specify length of data
  ./do.sh 1234567

Note
------
The size of data will become too large, around 2GB or below, if you specify the size over 10000000 (ten million).
